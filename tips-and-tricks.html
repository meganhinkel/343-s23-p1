        College Food Tips for Every Student!
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a meal plan: <p>Plan out your meals for the week before you go grocery shopping. This will help you to avoid impulse
        buys and to make sure you have enough food to last for the week.</p></li>

        <li>Buy in bulk: <p>Look for deals on non-perishable items like rice, beans, and pasta. Buying in bulk can save you money in
        the long run and you can portion out the items to make meals throughout the week.</p></li>

        <li>Shop in-season: <p>Buying fruits and vegetables that are in-season can save you money, as they are often cheaper and taste
        better than out-of-season produce.</p></li>

        <li>Cook in bulk: <p>Make large batches of food and freeze portions for later use. This will save you time and money on future
        meals.</p></li>

        <li>Use coupons and discounts: <p>Look for coupons and discounts on food items that you use regularly. Many grocery stores have
        loyalty programs that offer discounts to members.</p></li>

        <li>Use cheaper cuts of meat: <p>Look for cheaper cuts of meat like chicken thighs, pork shoulder, or ground beef. These cuts
        are often more flavorful and can be used in a variety of dishes.</p></li>

        <li>Meal prep: <p>Spend a few hours on the weekend prepping meals for the week. This will save you time during the week and
        help you to avoid eating out.</p></li>

        <li>Use leftovers: <p>Use leftovers to create new meals. For example, leftover chicken can be used to make a salad or sandwich.</p></li>

        <li>Buy store-brand items: <p>Store-brand items are often cheaper than name-brand items and are often just as good.</p></li>

        <li>Invest in a slow cooker: <p>A slow cooker is a great investment for college students. You can make a variety of meals with
        minimal effort, and it's a great way to use cheaper cuts of meat.</p></li>
