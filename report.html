  <h2>Technical Components</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>There are 5 different pages for our college recipe website. The first page is an homepage for our college
      recipe website. The second page, Meal Ideas, gives some simple meal ideas by time of day. The third page, Snack
      Ideas,
      gives various snack recipes. The fourth page gives specifically vegetarian and vegan recipes. The last page has
      some
      tips and tricks for food and a form to add suggestions.

    </li>
    <li>We have created a favicon that we use for each page.
      <img src="images/favicon.ico" alt="Favicon">
    </li>
    <li>Each page has the same size header, with a different color specifiying the page.
    </li>
    <li>Under the header, we have 5 nagivation links to each of the pages. A rectangular box around the page you are
      currently on indicates the page. A hover attributed is displayed, in which the link grows and becomes a solid
      rectangle with white font color.</li>
    <li>For each page, the horizontal navigation bar becomes vertical. Additionally, the images go from side to side by
      the recipes to above the recipes, and the form goes below the tips and tricks.</li>
    <li>Each image has a alt attribute.</li>
    <li>There are no errors with Nu or Wave. Each color palette has enough contrast to satisfy wave.</li>
    <li>The Heading uses 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;
      All other elements use Helvetica, sans-serif, Arial;
    </li>
    <li>The tips and tricks page has a form for suggestions. To submit a form, a valid email address has to be provided.</li>
    <li>At the bottom of each of the recipes pages lists links to the websites the recipes were taken from.</li>
    <li>
      The site is available at https://meganhinkel.github.io/343-s23-p1/index.html
